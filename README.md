Limitations live only in our minds. But if we use our imaginations, our possibilities become limitless. --Jamie Paolinetti
1. Your limitation—it’s only your imagination.
2. Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
3. Sometimes later becomes never. Do it now.
4. Great things never come from comfort zones.
